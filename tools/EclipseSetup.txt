This is a guide for setting up the VIC project in the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment.

1. Download and Install Eclipse:

	Choose either the C++ Development Tools option or install the CDT later on top of a general Eclipse installation (using Help -> Install New Software). Use the eclipse software repository which corresponds to your release of eclipse. For example, for the Juno release, use:
        http://download.eclipse.org/releases/juno/

2. Install the necessary NetCDF libraries.
	-The NetCDF C library is used to read input forcing files (ie this is <netcdf.h>)
	-Install the C library http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/
	
	-The NetCDF C++ library is used to read/write NetCDF outputs (ie this is <netcdf>)
		-If you have trouble installing the NetCDF C++ library and don't want NetCDF outputs
		then set NETCDF_OUTPUT_AVAILABLE to FALSE in user_def.h and the project should compile.
	-Download from https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/cxx4/
	./configure --enable-cxx-4
	make
	sudo make install

3. Set up the VIC project in Eclipse.

	-In Eclipse go to File -> New -> Project -> C++ Project
	-Type a project name (such as VIC)
	-For project type, choose Makefile project -> Empty Project
	-Deselect the "Use default location" checkbox and choose the folder location on disk where the VIC source code is located.
	-Click Next, Finish
	-The source files should appear in the Project Explorer pane.
	-Open up vicNl.c in Eclipse by double clicking on the file name in the Project Explorer pane.
	-There are probably errors (it will actually build correctly because it uses the makefile, but the Eclipse indexer can't find the included files)
	-Go to Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Tool Chain Editor
		-Change the Current Toolchain option from none, to an existing tool chain (Linux GCC)
		-You may need to uncheck the "Display compatible toolchains only" checkbox to get the option above
		-Click Apply, Click OK
	-Go to Project -> Properties -> C/C++ General -> File Types
	       - Change to "Use project settings"
	       - Add *.h as a C++ header file and *.c as a C++ source file
	-Right click the project folder name (VIC) in the Project Explorer
		-Click Index -> Rebuild
	-The errors should disappear and intellisense and auto complete should work properly.
		-If not see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7905025/string-could-not-resolved-error-in-eclipse-for-c
		-Also try setting Project -> Properties -> C/C++ Build -> Discovery Options -> Discovery Profile to the CPP setting for configuration wide settings
	-On the top menu click Run -> Run Configurations, open the Arguments tab and add the arguments (such as "-g glb_file.txt")
		-Deselect the Use default checkbox and change the working directory (usually the location of the global input file)
		-Click Apply, Click Close
